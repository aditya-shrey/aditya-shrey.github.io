[{"content":"Abstract Early detection of melanoma skin cancer is critical for effective treatment. In this study, we compare machine learning techniques, including CNNs, SVMs, Logistic Regression, and Transfer Learning with ResNet-18, using the Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset. Through pre-processing and hyperparameter optimization, we assess model performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings highlight CNNs’ efficacy in achieving high accuracy, with SVM and Transfer Learning also showing promise.

We programmed a virtual taxi to navigate this environment autonomously, relying solely on raw sensor measurements (e.g., GPS, IMU) and the bounding box output of object detection algorithms. The core challenge involved achieving robust perception and localization, allowing the taxi to understand its surroundings and precisely determine its position within the map. This perception data then fueled dynamic routing and motion planning. By leveraging this information, the taxi could navigate a designated sequence of pick-up and drop-off locations while adhering to a predefined set of traffic regulations (lane markings, stop signs, etc). We competed against other teams in a live event, and our success hinged on our ability to effectively combine localization, routing, motion planning, and perception to achieve safe and efficient autonomous navigation. Following our demo at the immersion showcase, we identified areas for improvement including resolving edge conditions with localization and fully-integrating perception.\nPresentation Slides Previous Next \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; / [pdf] View the PDF file here.
